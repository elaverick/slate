# Notepad Clone

A calm, liminal tool for text — built for large files, quiet focus, and the spaces in between.

This editor is intentionally simple. It’s designed to sit somewhere between a scratchpad and a file editor: fast to open, comfortable to keep running, and capable of handling very large text files without ceremony. There are no projects, tabs, or IDE features — just a persistent space for reading, writing, and making small, deliberate changes without friction or distraction

## Features

- Edit functions: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All
